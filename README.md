# Brief Summery of What Each Code does: 
## find_star.py:

### Inputs: 
- Where to take the fits files from.
- Where to save the .npy file containing the coordinates.
- What to name the aformentioned .npy file

### Outputs: 
- An .npy file containing the location to the star in question for the list of .fits files in the input folder. 

### How to operate: 
After typing in the needed parameters mentioned in **inputs**, images from the chosen folder pop up one by one. click on the **center** of the star that you are interested in. Keep doing this until there are no images left. the list of all the places you have clicked will be saved to an .npy file, so you wouldn't have to do it again.
